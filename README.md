# Floor 666 - VR Horror Game Scripts

This repository contains code and systems developed for Floor 666, a VR horror game I'm building solo. The project includes various gameplay systems, including enemy AI, interaction mechanics, and environmental events.

*As this is a one-person project still in active development, some of the code may be buggy, unoptimized, or incomplete. Balancing complexity and scope has led to a few shortcuts here and there â€” expect rough edges and ongoing changes.*
